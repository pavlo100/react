# React For Beginners â€” [ReactForBeginners.com](https://ReactForBeginners.com)

Starter files for the React For Beginners course. Come <a href="https://ReactForBeginners.com/">Learn React</a> with me!

The code in this repo meant to be a reference point for anyone following along with the video course.

## To Start

1. Copy the first folder, and rename to `catch-of-the-day`
2. cd into `catch-of-the-day` and follow along with the videos

Each folder contains only the changed files for each video, so if you need any code, pull the appropriate file into your `catch-of-the-day` folder.

You are welcome to submit Pull Requests but I'd like to keep the code at similar as possible to the course content. 

### Code Use

You are welcome to use this code in your own applications. If you would like to use it for training purposes, please shoot me a message first to make sure it's okay.
