# React For Beginners — [ReactForBeginners.com](https://ReactForBeginners.com)

Starter files for the React For Beginners course. Come <a href="https://ReactForBeginners.com/">Learn React</a> with me!

The code in this repo meant to be a reference point for anyone following along with the video course.

## To Start

1. Copy the first folder, and rename to `catch-of-the-day`
2. cd into `catch-of-the-day` and follow along with the videos

Each folder contains only the changed files for each video, so if you need any code, pull the appropriate file into your `catch-of-the-day` folder.

You are welcome to submit Pull Requests but I'd like to keep the code as similar as possible to the course content.

### Code Use

You are welcome to use this code in your own applications. If you would like to use it for training purposes, please shoot me a message first to make sure it's okay.


# Frequently Asked Questions

## I tried installing the Babel syntax highlighter but it didn't work!

There are a few possible options:

* If you are on Sublime Text 2, you should Upgrade to Sublime Text 3.
* Some users have reported restarting works
* You can try the [JavaScript Next](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScriptNext%20-%20ES6%20Syntax) syntax highlighter instead

## I can't set Babel at the default syntax higher!

Make sure you are in a file with the extension of `.js` before you do this step - you can't set the default for a file without having a file open!

## I can't see the React tab in my dev tools

Restart your dev tools or your chrome browser entirely

## What Sublime Text Packages are you using?

* Theme + Colour Scheme → [Cobalt 2](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2)
* JS Syntax Highlighting → [Babel](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Babel)
* HTML + CSS Shortcuts → [Emmet](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet)

## What is your terminal theme?

It's ZSH + Cobat2 for iTerm2. I did a whole video series on it → [CommandLinePowerUser.com](http://commandlinepoweruser.com/)


## I'm getting a weird error when I try run Gulp

Make sure you have the latest Node and NPM installed. If you run `node -v && npm -v` and get anything less than 4.0 and 3.0 you should download the installer from <http://nodejs.org> to upgrade.

## How do I use npm without sudo?

Running npm commands with `sudo` may cause security issues. Node and npm works well without super user privilages. Fortunately there is a very easy fix. Please follow the steps on [this article by Pawel Grzybek](http://studiorgb.uk/fix-priviliges-and-never-again-use-sudo-with-npm/). Enjoy using npm without 'sudo' now.
